But regulatory barriers and industry inertia stand in the way.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"spotlight-body\">\n          <p>\n            Construction has long been one of the slowest industries to adopt new technologies. While manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors have seen dramatic productivity gains over the past century, construction productivity has remained largely stagnant. This has contributed to rising housing costs, infrastructure delays, and buildings that are often less sustainable than they could be.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            However, a wave of innovation is now reaching the construction industry. 3D printing technologies can create building components—or even entire small buildings—in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. Prefabrication and modular construction techniques allow much of the building process to take place in controlled factory environments, reducing waste and improving quality.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            Mass timber construction, which uses engineered wood products like cross-laminated timber (CLT), is enabling wooden buildings to reach heights previously possible only with concrete and steel. These buildings can be constructed more quickly than conventional high-rises, with lower carbon emissions and often at lower cost.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            Digital tools are transforming design and project management. Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows architects, engineers, and contractors to collaborate on detailed 3D models, identifying potential conflicts before construction begins. Drones and robots are increasingly used for surveying, inspection, and even some construction tasks.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            Despite these promising developments, adoption remains slow. The fragmented nature of the construction industry, with many small firms and specialized trades, makes coordination difficult. Building codes and regulations, designed around traditional construction methods, often inadvertently block innovation. And because buildings are expected to last for decades, there's understandable caution about adopting unproven methods.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            Overcoming these barriers will require not just technological innovation but institutional innovation. Streamlined regulatory processes for evaluating new building systems, financial models that account for the different cost structures of innovative methods, and education for the construction workforce will all be essential.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            The potential rewards are enormous. More efficient construction could help address housing shortages, reduce the environmental impact of buildings (which account for about 40% of global carbon emissions), and create new categories of architecture that wouldn't be feasible with traditional methods.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"spotlight-footer\">\n          <Link to=\"/issue-16\" className=\"button\">Read full article in Issue 16</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport const Head = () => <Seo title=\"The future of construction | Works in Progress\" />\n\nexport default FutureConstructionPage ","/**\n * SEO component that queries for data with\n * Gatsby's useStaticQuery React hook\n *\n * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/use-static-query/\n */\n\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nimport { useStaticQuery, graphql } from \"gatsby\"\n\nfunction Seo({ description, title, children }) {\n  const { site } = useStaticQuery(\n    graphql`\n      query {\n        site {\n          siteMetadata {\n            title\n            description\n            author\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    `\n  )\n\n  const metaDescription = description || site.siteMetadata.description\n  const defaultTitle = site.siteMetadata?.title\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <title>{defaultTitle ? `${title} | ${defaultTitle}` : title}</title>\n      <meta name=\"description\" content={metaDescription} />\n      <meta property=\"og:title\" content={title} />\n      <meta property=\"og:description\" content={metaDescription} />\n      <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n      <meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" />\n      <meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content={site.siteMetadata?.author || ``} />\n      <meta name=\"twitter:title\" content={title} />\n      <meta name=\"twitter:description\" content={metaDescription} />\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Seo\n"],"names":["Head","React","Seo","title","FutureConstructionPage","Layout","className","StaticImage","src","width","quality","formats","alt","__imageData","require","Link","to","_ref","_site$siteMetadata","_site$siteMetadata2","description","children","site","useStaticQuery","metaDescription","siteMetadata","defaultTitle","name","content","property","author"],"sourceRoot":""}
